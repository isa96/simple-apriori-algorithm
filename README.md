# Simple Apriori Algorithm

Apriori is an Algorithm to finds Frequent itemset with support > minimum support. Support = Occurences.


## How to Run this Project

Install Jupyter Notebook first, you can download it from Anaconda website page.
[Download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
I recommend you to choose the 3.7 Python ver. instead.

After the Jupyter installed successfully , open the .ipynb files using Jupyter Notebook.

## Library Usage
For now, I'm using Pandas & Numpy to help me work on this project. Maybe there will be another libary I would use on the future.

## Note:
This is still a simple Apriori algorithm with few dataset and itemset. Any feedback would be much appreciated.
